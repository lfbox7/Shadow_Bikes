        <meta name="description" content="The local farmers are having problems with some pesky crows eating their crops. As a counter-measure, they have decided to concoct some pretty scary scarecrows; in fact, most of the farmers will be constructing multiple scarecrows for their fields. To make one scarecrow, they need one pumpkin for the head, some nuts for the eyes and mouth, and a carrot for the nose. At the local Farmer’s Market everyone is selling Halloween items, but the farmers all stop at Farmer Fred’s stand because he is selling everything that they need.Because of the increased demand for pumpkins, nuts, and carrots, Farmer Fred has asked for your help. He needs a way of displaying an up-to-date record of all the pumpkins, nuts and carrots he has in stock.">
